# PJR - TODO for boox performance analysis / learning

* Configure php to add the missing mysql/mariadb packages
* Look at using https://phpdocker.io to generate a shell Dockerfile / compose file?
** Check it's not a weird container though ...
* Add test query
* Add Authenticate query
** Add an 'in memory' table for active connections ?
* Add Login query
** This is authenticate plus getting context - this would be a list of authorised channels ?
* Build test Python client for Auth / Login
* Build loadtester
** Try AUTH's
** Needs to be multi-threaded ?
** or use a shell script to spawn a few of them?
* Auth could / should work with a hash of the password ?
* set up DB with both PW and HASH?

*** TUNING
* Use of nginx cache
* Use of php opcache
* Review issues in DB reported by phpmyadmin
* Difference between bx and nuc performance
* Try bx/nuc as server with other as client simulator

*** Compare to actual
* Review real DB schema

*** Functionality
* Do a proper login setting a DIGEST cookie or whatever
* Proper session control

*** Issues
* Does nginx limit the performance of the system?
** No long running PHP processes
*** Measure impact?
** No database persistence
*** Does a "db proxy" help?
** Compare to using apache2
